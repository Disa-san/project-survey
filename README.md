Survey-form

This purpose of this project was to practise using useState in React and to experiment with different types of survey functions. 

I enjoyed working on the project, which had just the right amount of creative freedom. 

If I had more time I would a have gone through any issues with accessibility and spent a bit more time on the design of the buttons on the form in addition to making it so that one question appears at a time.
