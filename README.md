Survey-form
Link to project: https://survey-form-disa.netlify.com/

This purpose of this project was to practise using useState in React and to experiment with different types of survey functions. 

I enjoyed working on the project, which had just the right amount of creative freedom. 

If time would have allowed for it, I would have gone through any potential accessibility issues and evolved the design of the form.
